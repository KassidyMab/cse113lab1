Purpose
-----
This program solves various geometry related problems by performing the
calulations for a given shape. It solves for triangles, regular polygons,
circles, and rectangles. Lookoing for the area and perimeter of all but
the regular polygon. It also solves for the hypotoneuse and length of a
diagonal rectangle.

Conclusion
-----
- I learned from this about handling massive amounts of functions and
that it is usually better to call upon an existing function than write
new code.

-Pair programming did not help.

-I worked alone on the lab however I did talk occasionally with my roommate
about how they implemented certain features for said lab.

-The main problem I encountered was adding the input function in a way that
worked adjusted towards specific shapes. I did this by having a switch
that had the particular shape's request already filled in.

- The main improvement I would make is have it do a shape that the user 
requests rather than all the operations. Doing every operation in a row makes
it kinda useless outside of a particular niche.
